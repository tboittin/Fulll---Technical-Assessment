# 🚀 Technical Assessment - Fulll

This repository contains the full set of deliverables for the technical assessment, encompassing two distinct projects: a front-end application of a github user searchbar and an algorithmic implementation of the FizzBuzz algorithm.

---

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

The repository is structured as a **monorepo**, with each technical exercise residing in its own sub-folder.

* **`Fulll - Technical Assessment/GitHub searchbar`**: The main front-end project.
* **`Fulll - Technical Assessment/Algo`**: The core algorithmic project (FizzBuzz).

Each project folder contains its own detailed **`README.md`** file with specific feature descriptions, testing instructions, and usage guides.

## 2. Advanced FizzBuzz Generator (Algorithm)

This project is an extensible and robust implementation of the classic FizzBuzz algorithm, written in **TypeScript**.

### 🌟 Key Highlights

* **Configurable Logic**: The core function accepts an array of custom rules (`{ divisor, word }`), allowing the user to extend the FizzBuzz pattern beyond the default 3 and 5.
* **Output**: The generated sequence is not only printed to the console but is also **automatically saved to a file** for easy review.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: TypeScript
* **Runtime**: Node.
